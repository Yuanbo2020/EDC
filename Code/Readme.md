# Generate code for EDC features
```
python edc.py -alpha 20 -length 500  -sub_dir test
```


If you want to use all the data of the training set and the test set in DCASE2018, please unzip the full_mel_feature_2.zip file and replace the mel_feature folder.

(If you are here, I believe you are an experienced programmer, just modify the input and output path of the file in edc.py by yourself)
